# SQL-codes
In this repo, SQL was used to build a structured database with primary/foreign keys and constraints for integrity. Queries handled CRUD operations, joins, and reports. Indexes improved performance while transactions ensured safety. Parameterized queries added security making the database efficient, reliable and well-integrated with the application.
