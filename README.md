## 👨‍💼 Employee Trends Analysis

### Overview
This project focuses on HR employee data to uncover workforce patterns and potential risk areas. The dataset covered demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, and attrition. SQL was used to explore and answer business-related questions.  

### Key Work
- Cleaned and validated employee data  
- Queried employee counts, averages, and distributions (by department, age, education)  
- Calculated attrition by age group and identified at-risk segments  
- Compared averages across employee groups for deeper insights  
- Highlighted job roles with high or low satisfaction levels  
- Applied `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `CASE` for trend analysis

## 🚙 Automotive Industry Trends

### Overview
This analysis focused on car sales data — including pricing history, mileage, transmission, and ownership details. The goal was to find pricing patterns, durable models, and forecast trends.  

### Key Work
- Explored dataset for data quality issues  
- Analyzed average price by fuel type, transmission, and ownership  
- Identified high-mileage models and compared to overall averages  
- Checked price variability within models to guide pricing strategy  
- Generated YoY price trends and moving averages for forecasting  
- Applied advanced SQL (`WINDOW FUNCTIONS`, `CTEs`, `JOINs`)  
- Ranked models based on selling price and long-term performance

## ☎️ Call Center Data Cleaning & Analysis

### Overview
This project cleaned and analyzed call center operations data to study call volume, satisfaction scores, and service efficiency.  

### Key Work
- Imported raw data and standardized formats (e.g., dates)  
- Replaced blanks and corrected invalid satisfaction scores  
- Generated summary statistics (row counts, distinct values)  
- Analyzed call volume by day and identified longest calls  
- Calculated min, max, and avg satisfaction scores (excluding invalid values)  
- Evaluated performance of different centers by response times

## 🛠 About SQL
**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is used to work with relational databases. Some key features include:  
- CRUD operations – create, read, update, delete  
- Joins – merging data across multiple tables  
- Aggregates – sum, count, average  
- Subqueries – advanced nested queries  
- Stored procedures – reusable logic  
- Window functions – ranking, moving averages  

I primarily worked on these projects using **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.
